            Ole Einar Bjørndalen (born 27 January 1974) is a retired Norwegian
            professional biathlete, often referred to by the nickname, the King
            of Biathlon. With 13 Winter Olympic Games medals, he is second on
            the list of multiple medalists behind Marit Bjørgen who has won 15
            medals. He is also the most successful biathlete of all time at the
            Biathlon World Championships, having won 45 medals, more than double
            that of any other biathlete except Martin Fourcade. With 95 World
            Cup wins, Bjørndalen is ranked first all-time for career victories
            on the Biathlon World Cup tour, more than twice that of anyone else
            but Fourcade. He has won the Overall World Cup title six times, in
            1997–98, in 2002–03, in 2004–05, in 2005–06, in 2007–08 and in
            2008–09.

          In 1992, he won his first career medal at the junior world
          championships. A year later in 1993, after winning three junior world
          championship titles, a medal haul only previously achieved by Sergei
          Tchepikov, Bjørndalen made his Biathlon World Cup debut. His
          breakthrough came in 1994 when he featured on his first World Cup
          podium in a sprint race held in Bad Gastein, Austria. Bjørndalen first
          competed in the Olympic Games at the Lillehammer 1994 Winter Olympics,
          held in his home country of Norway.

          He obtained his first major victory on 11 January 1996 in an
          individual competition held in Antholz-Anterselva, Italy. On 20
          February 2014, Bjørndalen was elected to an eight-year term at the
          International Olympic Committee's athlete commission. He resigned from
          this role in 2016 as he elected to continue his career.

            Domracheva started her sports career with cross-country skiing in
            1992 but switched to biathlon in 1999. She originally represented
            Russia at the junior level but received an offer to transfer to
            Belarus in 2004.She joined Belarus’ national biathlon team in 2006
            (having made her junior team debut in 2005). Domracheva won sprint
            and pursuit at the 2005 IBU Youth and Junior World Championships in
            Kontiolahti (Finland). She finished 40th in the individual race (the
            diopter fell off, and she missed 5 targets at the third shooting
            stage.

        <div class="content">
          Domracheva took 3rd place in the pursuit and 4th place in the
          individual events at the 2006 Junior World Championships in Presque
          Isle, Maine. In 2007, she picked up two silver medals in sprint and
          pursuit at the Junior World Championships in Martell, Italy.Her
          breakthrough came during the 2008/2009 season when she earned two
          third places and one second place. At the 2010 Winter Olympic Games in
          Vancouver, she won the bronze medal in the Women's 15-kilometer
          individual race at the Whistler Olympic Park venue. Later in the same
          season, on 13 March, she won her first World Cup race in the sprint in
          Kontiolahti, Finland. The next day she also won the pursuit.
          Domracheva was named Belarus' Female Athlete of the Year in 2010, and
          was also given the title of Honoured Master of Sport that year. She
          continued to improve after the Vancouver Olympics, winning 10 world
          cup races between the 2011-2013 seasons, as well as becoming the world
          champion in the pursuit in 2012, and the mass start in 2013. In 2014
          Domracheva was given the Hero of Belarus medal, after winning three
          gold medals at the 2014 Winter Olympics. In August 2015, Domracheva
          decided to skip the 2015–16 World Cup season due to mononucleosis
          which was diagnosed in July.

        <div class="content">
          Domracheva confirmed her pregnancy in April 2016,and said that she
          plans to return to compete in 2017. Domracheva returned to the World
          Cup in January 2017 for the 2016–17 season. Her comeback ended up
          being successful, winning a silver medal at the 2017 world
          championships in the individual pursuit in preparation for the 2018
          Winter Olympic Games. At the 2018 Winter Olympics, she was unable to
          defend her Olympic titles from Sochi; however she was still able to
          pick up a silver medal in the mass start individually, and helped the
          Belarusian team win the historic first Olympic gold medal in the
          relay.She finished the 2018 season ranked 3rd overall in the Biathlon
          World Cup, and announced her retirement in June, citing difficulties
          in combining both elite sport and parenting. She finished her career
          as Belarus’ most decorated winter Olympian, and most decorated
          Olympian of either the winter or summer games to compete for Belarus
          as an independent nation; gymnasts Olga Korbut and Vitaly Scherbo both
          have more medals, but Korbut competed for the Soviet Union and Scherbo
          only received 4 of his medals competing for Belarus; his remaining
          medals were won as part of the Unified Team. She was coached by former
          World Champion and Olympic medalist Klaus Siebert.[10] In September
          2019, she along with her husband Ole Einar Björndalen were appointed
          as biathlon coaches for the Chinese team, preparing the team for the
          2022 Olympic Winter Games in Beijing.

          Fourcade again improved in the 2009–10 season, consistently finishing
          in the top 10 and making the French team for the 2010 Winter Olympics,

          and followed up with two more first places at Oslo, in a sprint and
          another pursuit. The two pursuit victories meant Fourcade won the
